> "You don't get to commit the sin, and ask all of us to feel sorry for you for the consequences" -- Emily Blunt playing Kitty in *Oppenheimer (2023)*

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” -- Frank Herbert in *Dune*
