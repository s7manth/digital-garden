# Ideas 
- When I am reading, epsecially fiction, I feel visual imagery can make a huge difference. I struggle to keep up with the plethora of new words that I witness, and look up their meaning from time to time. Instead, there can be a plugin that knows the context of the book, and provides descriptive imagery based on the selected text. The themes of the images will be generated by a diffusion model, and it should be able to clearly point out which part of the story it's referring to.
