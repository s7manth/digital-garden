I love food. All food. Any food.

Think of it this way: someone long ago decided to playfully mix a few things, partly to satisfy their hunger, partly to satisfy their curiosity. The result of this experiment, once successful, evolved across generations and magincally lands on our plates. Imagine the joy back then on the success; imagine the joy now that you get to taste it!
