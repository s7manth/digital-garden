# About me

Hello, Wordl! This is Sumanth Yalamarty. I'm currently studying Computer Science at [NUS](https://nus.edu.sg).

I like to imagine the future, reflect on the past, and sometimes drift away from the present.

I love building stuff on computers, which I believe are the most portable applied sciences laboratories of this generation.

Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:syalamarty002@gmail.com?subject=Hey, Sumanth!), and I am sure we will have some fun time picking each other's brains.

Welcome to my website! Hope you have a good time around here.
