I think syntax and semantics are powerful descriptions of real life objects. So much so that they can offer a new perspective to thinking.

I think it allows us to separate things to their core and deal with both the raw bricks, cement and the grand skyscraper.

A few examples to understand syntax and semantics: \\(NaCl\\) and salt, body and soul, looking and observing, sentences and story, ink and signature, sounds and music, colors and a beautiful painting, noise and signal, wave and tsunami, facts and knowledge.

Syntax and semantics are everywhere. I think, as humans, we should focus on transforming syntactically available things into semantic objects. Something which encompasses a meaning, defines a purpose.

The greater the delta between your syntax and semantics, the greater is your value creation in life.
