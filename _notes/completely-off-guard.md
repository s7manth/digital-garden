There’s something to the feeling of getting caught off guard. Your hormone balance gets knocked off. Reason departs your conscience. Time slows down. Everything becomes crystal clear to you, or the illusion of it does. Gravity somehow pushes you up. There is a feeling of fear sprouting out of what’s going to happen next. Pupils dilate. Breath pauses. Chills run through the body. Saliva evaporates from your throat.
It is so calm even with so much happening at once.\
You tremble yet stay still. You speak yet whisper. You resist yet unsuccessful.\
You escape yourself.\
That’s what love does to you.
