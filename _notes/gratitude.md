Thank you to those who gave me birth so that I could cherish the beauties of this planet and mysteries of the cosmos. Thank you to those who invented the computer in front of me which allows me to explore and build things with confidence without relying on others. Thank you to those who invented and discovered the fundamental principles upon which this whole civilization rests. Thank you to those who made it possible so that I can live peacefully in a place provisioned with clean drinking water, adequate food, and pollution-free atmosphere to help me continue my life. Thank you to those who spent sleepless nights and worked religiously on ideas instead of rejecting them so that I am able to reap the benefits of a modern-day nomad.
