I've been recently fascinated by how much Latin phrases add to the ideas one communicates. Much like serifs in a typeface, they add a distinctive feel to the language.

Here's a list of some I found and have been trying to incorporate into my vernacular:

| Et alii (et al.) | And others, typically used in citations | [Vaswani et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) decided the future | |
